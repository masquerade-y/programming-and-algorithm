They are not full-blown interview questions, but do serve as a great start for getting your mind \"in the zone\" for recursion problems.\n\n\n______\n### Problem 1\n\n**Write a recursive function which takes an integer and computes the cumulative sum of 0 to that integer**\n\n**For example, if n=4 , return 4+3+2+1+0, which is 10.**\n\nThis problem is very similar to the factorial problem presented during the introduction to recursion. Remember, always think of what the base case will look like. In this case, we have a base case of n =0 (Note, you could have also designed the cut off to be 1).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n   n + (n-1) + (n-2) + .... + 0\n\nFill out a sample solution:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def rec_sum(n):\n    \n    #base case\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    # Recursion\n    else:\n        return n + rec_sum(n-1)\n    ","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rec_sum(4)","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":2,"data":{"text/plain":"10"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"______\n### Problem 2\n\n**Given an integer, create a function which returns the sum of all the individual digits in that integer.
