Make sure to think of the base case here.\n\nAgain, make sure you use *recursion* to accomplish this. **Do not slice (e.g. string[::-1]) or use iteration, there must be a recursive call for the function.**\n\n____\n\n### Solution\n\nIn order to reverse a string using recursion we need to consider what a base and recursive case would look like. Here we've set a base case to be when the length of the string we are passing through the function is length less than or equal to 1.\n\nDuring the recursive case we grab the first letter and add it on to the recursive call."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def reverse(s):\n    \n    # base case\n    if len(s) == 1:\n        return s\n    \n    # recursion\n    return reverse(s[1:]) + s[0]   # pay attention to the order of return, put s[0] at the end ","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"reverse('hello world')","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":2,"data":{"text/plain":"'dlrow olleh'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Test Your Solution\n\nRun the cell below to test your solution against the following cases:\n\n    string = 'hello'\n    string = 'hello world'\n    string = '123456789'"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%pip install nose","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"Collecting nose\n  Downloading nose-1.3.7-py3-none-any.whl (154 kB)\n\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 154 kB 4.1 MB/s eta 0:00:01\n\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: nose\nSuccessfully installed nose-1.3.7\nNote: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''\nRUN THIS CELL TO TEST YOUR FUNCTION AGAINST SOME TEST CASES\n'''\n\nfrom nose.tools import assert_equal\n\nclass TestReverse(object):\n    \n    def test_rev(self,solution):\n        assert_equal(solution('hello'),'olleh')\n        assert_equal(solution('hello world'),'dlrow olleh')\n        assert_equal(solution('123456789'),'987654321')\n        \n        print('PASSED ALL TEST CASES!')\n        \n# Run Tests\ntest = TestReverse()\ntest.test_rev(reverse)","execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"PASSED ALL TEST CASES!\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Extra Notes\n\nThe \"trick\" to this question was thinking about what a base case would look like when reversing a string recursively.
