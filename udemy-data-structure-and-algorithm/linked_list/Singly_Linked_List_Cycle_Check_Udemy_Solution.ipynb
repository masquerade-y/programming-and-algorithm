This is also sometimes known as a circularly linked list.\n\nYou've been given the Linked List Node class code:"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"class Node(object):\n    \n    def __init__(self,value):\n        \n        self.value = value\n        self.nextnode = None","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Solution\n\nTo solve this problem we will have two markers traversing through the list. **marker1** and **marker2**. We will have both makers begin at the first node of the list and traverse through the linked list. However the second marker, marker2, will move two nodes ahead for every one node that marker1 moves.\n\nBy this logic we can imagine that the markers are \"racing\" through the linked list, with marker2 moving faster. If the linked list has a cylce and is circularly connected we will have the analogy of a track, in this case the marker2 will eventually be \"lapping\" the marker1 and they will equal each other. \n\nIf the linked list has no cycle, then marker2 should be able to continue on until the very end, never equaling the first marker.\n\nLet's see this logic coded out:"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def cycle_check(node):\n\n    # Begin both markers at the first node\n    marker1 = node\n    marker2 = node\n\n    # Go until end of list\n    while marker2 != None and marker2.nextnode != None:\n        \n        # Note\n        marker1 = marker1.nextnode\n        marker2 = marker2.nextnode.nextnode\n\n        # Check if the markers have matched\n        if marker2 == marker1:\n            return True\n\n    # Case where marker ahead reaches the end of the list\n    return False","execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Test Your Solution"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nRUN THIS CELL TO TEST YOUR SOLUTION\n\"\"\"\nfrom nose.tools import assert_equal\n\n# CREATE CYCLE LIST\na = Node(1)\nb = Node(2)\nc = Node(3)\n\na.nextnode = b\nb.nextnode = c\nc.nextnode = a # Cycle Here!\n\n\n# CREATE NON CYCLE LIST\nx = Node(1)\ny = Node(2)\nz = Node(3)\n\nx.nextnode = y\ny.nextnode = z\n\n\n#############\nclass TestCycleCheck(object):\n    \n    def test(self,sol):\n        assert_equal(sol(a),True)\n        assert_equal(sol(x),False)\n        \n        print \"ALL TEST CASES PASSED\"\n        \n# Run Tests\n\nt = TestCycleCheck()\nt.test(cycle_check)\n","execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"ALL TEST CASES PASSED\n"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Good Job!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.8","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
