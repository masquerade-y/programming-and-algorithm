There are better solutions involving memoization and simple iterative solutions.If you are having trouble with this problem (or it seems to be taking a long time to run in some cases) check out the Solution Notebook and fully read the conclusion link for a detailed description of the various ways to solve this problem!**\n\n\nThis problem is common enough that is actually has its own [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem)! Let's check the problem statement again:\n\nThis is a classic recursion problem: Given a target amount **n** and a list (array) of distinct coin values, what's the fewest coins needed to make the change amount. \n\nFor example:\n\nIf n = 10 and coins = [1,5,10]. Then there are 4 possible ways to make change:\n\n* 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1\n\n* 5 + 1+1+1+1+1\n\n* 5+5\n\n* 10\n\nWith 1 coin being the minimum amount.\n\n    \n## Solution\n\nThis is a classic problem to show the value of dynamic programming. We'll show a basic recursive example and show why it's actually not the best way to solve this problem.\n\nMake sure to read the comments in the code below to fully understand the basic logic!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def rec_coin(target,coins):\n    '''\n    INPUT: Target change amount and list of coin values\n    OUTPUT: Minimum coins needed to make change\n    \n    Note, this solution is not optimized.\n    '''\n    \n    # Default to target value\n    min_coins = target\n    \n    # Check to see if we have a single coin match (BASE CASE)\n    if target in coins:\n        return 1\n    \n    else:\n        \n        # for every coin value that is <= than target\n        for i in [c for c in coins if c <= target]:\n            \n            # Recursive Call (add a count coin and subtract from the target) \n            num_coins = 1 + rec_coin(target-i,coins)\n            \n            # Reset Minimum if we have a new minimum\n            if num_coins < min_coins:\n                \n                min_coins = num_coins\n                \n    return min_coins","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see it in action."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"rec_coin(63,[1,5,10,25])","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"6"},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The problem with this approach is that it is very inefficient!
