For your homework assignment, read the [Wikipedia article on Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization), before continuing on with this lecture!\n\n____\n\nMemoization effectively refers to remembering (\"memoization\" -> \"memorandum\" -> to be remembered) results of method calls based on the method inputs and then returning the remembered result rather than computing the result again. You can think of it as a cache for method results. We'll use this in some of the interview problems as improved versions of a purely recursive solution.\n\nA simple example for computing factorials using memoization in Python would be something like this:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# recursion without Memoization\ndef factorial(k):\n    \n    if k < 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return k * factorial(k-1)","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create cache for known results\nfactorial_memo = {}\n\ndef factorial_m(k):\n    \n    if k < 2: \n        return 1\n    \n    if not k in factorial_memo:\n        factorial_memo[k] = k * factorial_m(k-1)\n        \n    return factorial_memo[k]","execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%timeit\n\nfactorial(4)","execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"436 ns ± 6.23 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%timeit\n\nfactorial_m(4)","execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"152 ns ± 1.37 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note how we are now using a dictionary to store previous results of the factorial function!
