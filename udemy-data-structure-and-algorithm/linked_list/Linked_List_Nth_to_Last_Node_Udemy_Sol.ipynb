We could walk this \"block\" all the way down the list, and once the front of the block reached the end, then the other end of the block would be a the Nth node!  \n\nSo to implement this \"block\" we would just have two pointers a left and right pair of pointers. Let's mark out the steps we will need to take:\n\n* Walk one pointer **n** nodes from the head, this will be the right_point\n* Put the other pointer at the head, this will be the left_point\n* Walk/traverse the block (both pointers) towards the tail, one node at a time, keeping a distance **n** between them.\n* Once the right_point has hit the tail, we know that the left point is at the target.\n\nLet's see the code for this!"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def nth_to_last_node(n, head):\n\n    left_pointer  = head\n    right_pointer = head\n\n    # Set right pointer at n nodes away from head\n    for i in xrange(n-1):\n        \n        # Check for edge case of not having enough nodes!\n        if not right_pointer.nextnode:\n            raise LookupError('Error: n is larger than the linked list.')\n\n        # Otherwise, we can set the block\n        right_pointer = right_pointer.nextnode\n\n    # Move the block down the linked list\n    while right_pointer.nextnode:\n        left_pointer  = left_pointer.nextnode\n        right_pointer = right_pointer.nextnode\n\n    # Now return left pointer, its at the nth to last element!\n    return left_pointer","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Test Your Solution"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nRUN THIS CELL TO TEST YOUR SOLUTION AGAINST A TEST CASE \n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS IS JUST ONE CASE\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom nose.tools import assert_equal\n\na = Node(1)\nb = Node(2)\nc = Node(3)\nd = Node(4)\ne = Node(5)\n\na.nextnode = b\nb.nextnode = c\nc.nextnode = d\nd.nextnode = e\n\n####\n\nclass TestNLast(object):\n    \n    def test(self,sol):\n        \n        assert_equal(sol(2,a),d)\n        print 'ALL TEST CASES PASSED'\n        \n# Run tests\nt = TestNLast()\nt.test(nth_to_last_node)","execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"ALL TEST CASES PASSED\n"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Good Job!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.8","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
