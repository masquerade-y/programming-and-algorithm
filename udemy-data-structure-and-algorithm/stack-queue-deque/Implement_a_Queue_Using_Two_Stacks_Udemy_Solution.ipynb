A sequence of elements pushed on a stack comes back in reversed order when popped. Consequently, two stacks chained together will return elements in the same order, since reversed order reversed again is original order.\n\n We use an in-stack that we fill when an element is enqueued and the dequeue operation takes elements from an out-stack. If the out-stack is empty we pop all elements from the in-stack and push them onto the out-stack.
